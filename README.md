# 🧠 Digit Span Test

This is a **Digit Span Memory Test** built using **Python and Tkinter**.  
It evaluates your **working memory** by asking you to recall increasingly longer sequences of digits.

## 🚀 How It Works

- A sequence of random digits is displayed one-by-one.
- You must **repeat the digits in the correct order** after the display ends.
- Each correct answer increases the sequence length by 1.
- You can make up to **3 mistakes** before the test ends.

## 📦 Features

- Full-screen GUI using Tkinter
- Adaptive difficulty based on user performance
- Prevents consecutive digits for added challenge
- Tracks and displays your score
- Clean interface with keyboard or button control
